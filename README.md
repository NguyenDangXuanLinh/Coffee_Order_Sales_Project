# Coffee Order Sales Dashboard

In this project, I will build a dynamic interactive sales dashboard using Excel. 

To be more specific, I first gathered the data, and then use maily XLookup and Match functions to clean and analyze data. 


Then, I used pivot tables and pivot charts to customerize my visuals on the dashboard
